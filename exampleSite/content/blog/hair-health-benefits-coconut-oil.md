**Fights fungal infections**

Healthy hair begins at the root. Keeping your scalp healthy may help your hair grow better.

One recent lab study found that coconut oil helped to get rid of some types of fungal infections.

Coconut oil may help heal or prevent dandruff and other fungi on the scalp. More research is needed to know if coconut oil has the same health benefits on the skin and scalp.

**Calms irritation**

Coconut oil is a natural saturated fat. The high fat content in it may help calm scalp irritation, flaking, and itching. The fat in coconut oil can also help seal in hair moisture.

**Treats split ends**

A review in 2015Trusted Source noted that coconut oil absorbs into hair strands better than mineral oil and other kinds of oils. This might help prevent hair breaking and split ends.

For this reason, you may need fewer trims when you use coconut oil on your hair regularly. This might make it seem like your hair is growing longer, faster.

Another review on the uses of coconut oil in India found that the oil may help reduce protein loss in hair. This prevents dry, brittle, or breaking hair. The researchers note that in India, coconut oil is used both as a hair mask before showering and as a leave-in conditioner after showering.

**Protects from heat damage**

Using a small amount of coconut oil on wet hair before drying or using heat styling may protect hair from water and heat damage.

Hygral fatigue happens when the hair swells up from too much water. Too much swelling can damage the hair or make it break. This can make hair drier and weaker over time.
