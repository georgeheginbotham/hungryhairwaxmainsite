# How does beeswax benefit your hair?

**Moisturize**

One of the biggest benefits is moisture. The vitamin A content in beeswax helps to moisturize hair, while its overall formula locks in that moisture.

**Smooth and straighten**

People who find their hair difficult to manage also use beeswax to smooth flyaway strands, keep styles intact, and straighten their hair.

**Seal strands**

Its ability to seal strands makes beeswax a good way to hide split ends.

**Promote hair growth**

Beeswax can also be used to promote hair growth. A 2016 study found that a hair wax containing beeswax significantly increased hair length after daily use for 30 days.

**Soothe scalp conditions**

Beeswax can have a positive effect on the scalp, too. Research has shown it can soothe symptoms of skin conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, and dandruff.
