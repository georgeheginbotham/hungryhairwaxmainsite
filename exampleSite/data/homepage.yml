  title : "<br><br>About hungryhairwax"
  subtitle : "Founder - George Anthony Heginbotham"
  content : "I created our natural hair wax because I couldn't find natural hair wax in South Africa.
           I experimented with a few online recipes, then formulated my own. I'm happy to say this product is perfect, as perfect as a natural hair wax can get!
          It gives the hair an all-day natural hold and subtle shine. Plus, you get all the antioxidants and minerals from the raw natural ingredients."
